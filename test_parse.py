The Q2 revenue grew 16.2% year-over-year, and HCG centers by 18.1%. Okay.

Within HCG centers, Western India comprising Gujarat and Maharashtra contributed 42% of the total revenue, followed by Karnataka 38%; Andhra Pradesh is 8%; and East India a 7%. As we can see from this, our distribution has changed &#x2013; at one time Karnataka was heavily favored now, it is being distributed between Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra and Tamil Nadu and East India. I would like &#x2013; Tamil Nadu contributed 4% and North India contributed only 1%.</p>\r\n          <p>I would like to draw your attention to slide 6 of the presentation. Strong growth continues at several existing and new centers in Q2. Vijayawada 80% Y-o-Y; Nashik 79% with expansion taking place 79.9% Y-o-Y; Chennai 28.7% Y-o-Y; and Baroda 24.3% Y-o-Y, substantial growth has happened in these new centers &#x2013; in these existing and new centers. New centers contributed revenue of INR 48.6 crores in Q2. Revenue from existing HCG centers grew at 11% in Q2 Y-o-Y basis. Revenue excluding Kanpur, which were discontinued operations, grew 20% in Q2 and 21.1% in H1 FY 2019 on a Y-o-Y basis.</p>\r\n          <p>I would now like to draw your attention to slide 8 of the presentation. 165 beds added in Q2 FY 2019 on account of new centers, Rajkot 120 beds and Jaipur 45 beds. ARPOB of existing centers INR 34,624 against INR 33,463 in Q2 FY 2018. Continuing reduction in ALOS to 2.27 on account of trend towards day care procedures, changing patient profile and efficiency in the system. Existing centers operating EBITDA margin improved 69 bps to 24.4% in FY 2019 from 23.7% in Q2. In this area, I\'d also like to mention some of our centers have been star performers, including our center of excellence in Bangalore, which has shown 28%-plus margin in Bangalore center.</p>\r\n          <p>Looking at key geographies in slide 9, Karnataka region continues its focus on improving realization parameters. The center of excellence, as I\'ve stated above, ARPOB is 48.4% with 28.3% operating EBITDA margin. The center of excellence ROCE improved 110 bps to 28.8% Y-o-Y. ARPOB dip (sic) [rise] (00:11:12) region driven by scale up of multispecialty in Hubli. With respect to Gujarat region, commencement of oncology centers in Bhavnagar offering comprehensive services, Rajkot multispecialty center just operationalized, and EBITDA margin of existing centers at 19.1% for Q2 FY 2019 from 15.7% for Q2 FY 2018.</p>\r\n          <p>In Maharashtra, continued strong growth of Nashik center with Phase II operationalized and EBITDA margin at 23.4%. In Andhra Pradesh, strong revenue &#x2013; Borivali and Nagpur new centers ramping up with continued reduction in losses, and as I already commented, we are looking at a breakeven in Q4. In Andhra Pradesh, strong revenue growth, occupancy increase, and ARPOB dilution driven by consolidation of partners business in Vijayawada. New centers in Vizag ramping up well. In East India, investments in enhancing quality of care at Cuttack centers. The improved patient and procedure mix augmenting ARPOB increase.</p>\r\n          <p>Coming to slide 10, covering key highlights in Milann fertility business center. The improvement has happened in new registration driven by new centers additions, newly-opened center in attractive Whitefield market ramping up well, implementation of new strategic initiatives across the business are helping to show ramp up in the third and fourth quarter is &#x2013; also is expected in fourth quarter.</p>\r\n          <p>I now request Srini Raghavan to explain the CapEx and debt highlights.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="3">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Thanks, Dr. Ajai. I would like to draw your attention to slide number 12. We are nearing the last leg of our expansion plan. Total CapEx for the quarter was INR 41.4 crores with majority of that in HCG centers and a nominal investment of INR 2 million in Milann. CapEx excludes stake purchase for INR 23.5 crores towards minority interest of partner in Borivali center entity.</p>\r\n          <p>Net debt, with respect to debt, we closed the quarter at net debt of INR 579.6 crores, of which vendor finance comprises of INR 169.8 crores. This includes forex reinstatement of INR 8.3 crores as at September 30, 2018 and INR 6.2 crores as of June 30, 2018 on account of USD-INR exchange rate changes. As on H1 basis, majority of the CapEx of Kolkata and South Mumbai centers are already accounted.</p>\r\n          <p>I would like to draw your attention to slide number 14 please. In the current year, Kolkata and South Mumbai are slated to launch in next two quarters, with this only two more centers in Kochi and Gurgaon will be upcoming for future. We do not have any more committed new centers for Milann post Q1 launch of Whitefield centers.</p>\r\n          <p>Would like to handover back to Niraj.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="1">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Thanks, Srini and Dr. Ajai for sharing the financial and business highlights. We would like to open the call now to take questions from the participants.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n    </section>\r\n    <section name="Q&amp;A">\r\n      <speaker id="0">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Sure. Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have the first question from the line of Sudarshan Padmanabhan from Sundaram Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="4" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Hello. Thank you for taking my question. Sir, I think while...</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="0">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>I\'m sorry to interrupt you, Sudarshan, but we can barely hear you. Could you please speak a little louder?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="4" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. Can you hear me now?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="0">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yes. Please go ahead.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="4" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. Sir, while your presentation and your outlook talks about the newer projects and the losses contributed by the newer facilities, if you can kind of give some color with respect the Borivali facility and probably what is the kind of or the magnitude of losses, which primary on account of the facility you opened this quarter, specifically the 140-odd beds, Nashik and Jaipur? I mean, that could kind of give us some color with respect to directionally how the Borivali is moving, as well as how we expect the Nashik and Jaipur to move as well?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Thank you, sir. As far as Borivali is concerned, as you know, when the center started last October, we had indicated there will be a loss for about 18 months and primarily because of the real estate, high value of rent. But we are actually clocking well, and in this regard, I will ask Dinesh, who is the Business Head &#x2013; Dinesh Madhavan, who is the Business Head of the region to talk about it. And also he can comment on the Nashik where in spite of expansion, we have not incurred any loss, in fact we have continued to have a margin of 23%, the expansion has already happened. In view of Jaipur which has just started, right now which is a oncology center, there also we are doing well, month on month we are seeing a good growth, and there also we expect in the next four to six months the losses to narrow.</p>\r\n          <p>Regarding the Borivali, can you comment on it?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="5" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Both at Borivali and Nashik in Maharashtra, we are finding the expansion of Nashik at the new centers, the greater acceptance has ramped up well, which is clearly indicated in terms of addition of more than about 60 bed, we still have been able to have a good financial performance there.</p>\r\n          <p>Coming to Borivali, there are a few segments which will catch up as what Ajai said in the last quarter of this fiscal, whereas largely for the transplant program on the bone marrow and in the radiation, we\'ve done far better than what we perceived as per our plan. Going forward, we\'re only seeing that the ramp up here will be as we expected to be and also take a very dominant leadership space in the private oncology space in Bombay. Borivali will see from Q2 much better than what we had actually looked at from a budgeted level and we &#x2013; as we said little earlier, we look at it ramping up as expected.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>And in this regard, our losses for Q2 in the oncology space and including Milann has been INR 3.7 crores, and we do believe if it is on the increasing trend, but even if you look at Borivali and Nagpur, both have significantly decreased on a quarter-to-quarter basis also and we\'ll continue to see that. As I said, we are hoping that the way things are going, breakeven will happen in Q4 or Q1 of next year.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="4" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Sure, sir. Sir, with respect to the debt, I mean I understand the part of this &#x2013; a large part of this debt primarily comes from the newer centers. I mean if I &#x2013; you did pass a comment that part of the future CapEx is also included in the current debt. So, if I can get some idea with respect to &#x2013; because I think the debt has consistently been moving up, where do we expect the peak debt? I mean, do we see that probably this is where the peak debt is, and as Borivali starts contributing to profits and other centers starts contributing to profit, your debt will start coming down? Is that a fair assumption?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. As mentioned earlier, we\'ve come to almost to the end of our CapEx cycle, and from here onwards, we expect the CapEx to kind of taper down, we expect &#x2013; and our debt also coming down. So, by the year end, we see all the leverage ratios at the right level from a debt perspective. But there are few commitments where you may see slight increase even up to the end of the year. The way we have structured and the way already commitments are made is what we\'re going to fulfill. But as you said, Sudarshan, once the Borivali and few other centers turn profitable and few other changes take place, we expect CapEx cycle to be over and the debt reduction to start.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="4" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. One final question from my side is, on the Milann side of the business, I mean I think the last couple of quarters has been pretty soft in terms of execution and performance, I\'m just trying to understand with respect to what are the changes &#x2013; I understand that we have taken a rationalization with respect to looking at profitability and other things. So, I mean, where are we as far as the benefits are concerned from this exercise?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>I think for Milann, as I discussed briefly last time, we had few things which happened in the last first quarter and second quarter which caused the downturn. And now, we have a new CFO (sic) [CEO] (00:21:10), who has joined few months ago, Sudhir Bahl, and with under his leadership, [ph] we\'ve restructured (00:21:18) even our existing centers and the new centers. We are beginning to see certainly ramp up happening and we expect fourth quarter to be one of the best quarters. So, it is in mind I think we are well-positioned for that, and also when we look at the future, like the year FY 2020, the way systems are being put in place where certain strategic initiatives we have taken, overall, are also definitely going to pay dividends in the FY 2020. We are fairly confident about it with the new CEO being in place.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="4" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Sure, sir. That\'s it from my side. I\'ll join back the queue.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="0">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Balthazar Florentin-Lee from Sloane Robinson. Please go ahead.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="6" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Good afternoon and congratulations on another set of solid numbers, and it\'s always good to see the margin at the existing centers expanding. Can I just ask sort of a bit more clarity on the trend in the losses from new centers? If Borivali is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:22:31) even in the next couple of quarters and the losses are declining there and you don\'t have any expansion projects planned for Q3, is it fair to say that what we\'ve just experienced is peak loss and we should be thinking about a lower figure consistently going forward?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="3" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>I think you\'re right. I think as we go forward, once the Borivali center, the Nagpur centers breakeven, the centers which are still in under losses include Jaipur and Rajkot, and then future is of course when the Delhi center opens. So, these are all the centers which are lined up. So, only few centers will be coming up as per the plan. So, with this plan, we expect the losses to narrow, not only narrow, but also possibly the losses may go away if the Borivali center, Nagpur and the way Nashik centers are growing, they will certainly contribute positive EBITDA to the whole group, so that may actually decrease the overall loss. That is how we are looking at. So, in the next 12 months period, certainly that transformation is likely to happen. And all the &#x2013; when you look at how we are positioned now, when you look at the EBITDA, like you see existing centers EBITDA was INR 37 crores.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="6" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>So, obviously, that existing centers EBITDA will normally &#x2013; they\'ve been growing at about 10% or so. So, that will continue to grow, and added to this, we\'ll see the new centers contribution to the EBITDA. And as the losses get down, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:24:23) and new profitability will also be added. So, that is where the major upturn is going to happen as this transformation happens.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="6" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>And you say over the next 12 months, do you have the visibility, yes, that when we might see this inflection?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>As I said, the two centers are either in Q4 or Q1 of next year &#x2013; Borivali, Nagpur are going to breakeven. The only centers which are still going to be somewhat negative maybe Jaipur and Rajkot. Jaipur is probably breakeven earlier and Rajkot is the one which is newly started, which is probably going to take &#x2013; we\'re still looking at the numbers, based on another six to eight months to breakeven. So, that is why we expect second and third quarter of next year when we\'ll start seeing most of the centers being more positive at EBITDA breakeven. Usually in our scenario, as we have stated before, it takes about 12 months for any center to breakeven. One exception that being actually I\'ve stated is Borivali center, because of the high rent, otherwise normally 12 to 14 months they breakeven.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="6" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Excellent. Thank you very much. I\'ll go back into queue for any additional questions.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="0">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Sure. Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The next question is from the line of Arshad Mukadam from Vibrant Securities. Please go ahead.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="7" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. Hi. So, my first question is regarding the Mumbai center, the South Mumbai center, which is planned to open in Q4. So, I think a few quarters ago, this was supposed to be opened in Q4 2018, but now it\'s been pushed to almost a year behind. So, what\'s the reason for this?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. I think the main reason is the regulatory issues, because we have put a bunker in already which was existing as a cobalt bunker. We had to strengthen that, the AERB required us to strengthen that, the traditional material steel and we had to redo that, and that took a lot of time in getting the approval from the AERB itself took time. And that was one of the primary reasons and also we got very new equipment called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:26:58) is coming first time in India for us in Mumbai as well as in Calcutta. So, that required a type approval from AERB. Type approval is the first time when any equipment comes, it takes a long time. It took maybe three to four months for the AERB to look at it and actually they have to make a physical visit and approve that. So, these are the two factors, obviously, which was not under our control which caused the delay. Now, I think we\'re almost in the final stage, and Dinesh, you want to add anything?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="5" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>We should look at starting our outpatient services by the Q4 of this fiscal.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="7" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>All right. Okay. My next question is regarding &#x2013; I think while answering your previous question, you had mentioned that the CapEx has peaked out and it will start to decrease from now on. So, are you saying that after the launch of the Mumbai and the Kolkata centers, are you saying that for the next two years or something that we won\'t be planning on opening any more centers?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>No. There\'s couple of others &#x2013; a few things are in the works. For example, as I mentioned, in the Q4 asset cycle, you may see a slight increase in the debt because of the Mumbai center and all coming there. Then, we have in future, the centers we still have in New Delhi &#x2013; the Delhi center, the Gurgaon center, and there is also we have some plans in the Cochin center. So, if that happens, there will be one more center. Otherwise, most of the CapEx cycle will be done and we don\'t have any new either Greenfield or Brownfield centers plan. And answer to your question for two years, yes, we would like to be in a consolidation mode as far as the oncology is concerned. So, we are certainly looking at consolidating these centers that is our plan at present.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="7" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Okay. No. That sounds great. So, now if I can just another question regarding Milann, so again in response to your previous question you mentioned that we appointed new CEO and now the business is supposed to pick up going forward. And if I remember correctly, last quarter on the con call you mentioned that it was the absence of a prominent doctor was the reason for de-growth in the revenues. So, is this a business reliant on the doctors, like if the doctors leaves and will that affect us?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Hello?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="7" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Hello?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="7" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. So, I wanted to know dependence on the doctors in this business, is it the risk of doctors leaving out and the business de-growing?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>No. Like I told you, the way &#x2013; the previously as I mentioned, because of a prominent doctor due to personal reasons, she\'s not available, affected the region in the Bangalore, but now with the new CEO, we are now institutionalizing entire Milann. As you know, Milann has been rated number one and when we merged, when we took over 51% our other partners, Dr. Kamini Rao, who is a very well-known leading fertility specialist. That\'s the reason we took. The transition from that to institutionalization is what we are trying to do with the new CEO being in place.</p>\r\n          <p>In this regard, we are actually now not only in Bangalore, but we are also in Delhi and Chandigarh and few other places to make it a national entity and institutionalize this. In this regard, we have created <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:30:45) model and with this new initiative of different doctors, several doctors being there as consultants, full-time as well as visiting, these changes is what will make it institutionalize just like we have done for HCG, and that is what we are good at and that is what we will achieve in the next few quarters or so.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="7" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Okay. That\'s good to hear. And one lastly, could you just explain to me what exactly you meant by IVF cycles in new registrations and how that bring to avenue growth going forward?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>IVF cycles?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="7" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Given in the presentation.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Sudhir, can you explain?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="8" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>What\'s the question?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>IVF cycles and how does it impact the revenue?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="3" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>No, registration.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Registration or number of cycles, IVF cycles?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="7" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. I just wanted to understand how those affect the revenues going forward?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="8" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>If you look at the registrations, basically a new registration to IVY cycle lead time is 60 to 90 days, and whenever we plan for IVF cycle, we focus on increasing the registration <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:31:54). So, if you look at new registration Q2 versus FY 2019, it is 1,394 which has shown a 15% jump, and because of which our Q3 and Q4 revenues are expected to be higher due to higher IVF cycles. Does it answer your question?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="7" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yes. Yes, that helps quite a bit.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="8" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Okay.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="7" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.

Please go ahead.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Hi. Good evening. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:32:36) the first question is on just the absolute EBITDA that you\'ve reported. Is it right to understand that you have included the government grant revenue in the reported EBITDA number of INR 36 crores on the PBT?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yes, please, we have included. Yes.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Right. And is this government grant amount &#x2013; I think the first half, it\'s about INR 11.5 crores. Is this recurring item, going forward into the next quarters?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yes. It will recur in the subsequent quarters also.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Right. I don\'t think this was there in the previous year, right? So, if you could just give us some color on why this is now a new item in our revenues?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>It was a change in the method of accounting as per the new standard, earlier it was shown as part of the revenue. As per the new standard, it has been shown in a separate line. That\'s the reason why it has been shown like this.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="3" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>And as you know, these accounting standards continue to change. You\'ll also see changes next year where there will be some changes related to rental, so next Q1. So, these changes, is what we\'ll go by what auditors advice is to do.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Just for the sake of clarity, I guess it\'s not INR 11 crore. It is INR 1 crore.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="3" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Right. Thank you.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="3" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. It\'s a small number.

I think second is just related to Rajkot. So, you mentioned that it\'s a 120 bed multi-spec facility that you opened in Rajkot. So, if you could just give us some color on what the ownership structure is there, what percentage you own, as well as what percentage of the beds have been opened as of now?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>This Rajkot facility just started, it was inaugurated only about two weeks ago, okay, and it is doctors\' partnership model, where the doctors are 26% partner. Most of the doctors are very leading practitioners of cardiology, nephrology and pulmonary medicine, ICU, as well as primary physicians, very good group. In fact, I personally visited them and met all the doctors at the time of inauguration and very motivated and hospital has a very good name now. They all were having good names. So, we expect the hospital which is run under HCG is going to have a very good name, and at this point, it is very initial stage. So, we expect as you said the growth to happen in the next four to six months, and the Center Manager, the Business Head of Gujarat are quite optimistic about the Rajkot project.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Right. Thank you. And the third question is on Kochi and Delhi, right, in your presentation, it looks like Kolkata and South Mumbai should open in the final quarter of this year, which leaves just Kochi and Delhi for next year. So, could you just give us some perspective on whether it\'s likely to be first half of next year or maybe back ended, because I think there is quite a lot of new facilities between now and the first half of next year.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. Regarding the Delhi project, I think it is going to take &#x2013; we\'re going to give guidance once we get all the regulatory approvals. Because as you know, regulatory approvals is always uncertain and for the type of center we\'re building there, we have done lot of work like soil testing, water testing, lot of issues have done. So, we are waiting for the ARB approval. Once the approval comes, I think we\'ll be able to have a better guidance to you, and regarding when the project will take off and how long will it take for us to complete the project. But if the approval comes, we expect about 18 months <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:36:42)</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="10" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:36:44)</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>You can come closer. Anant is the Project Director. He can give...</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="10" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>I think if the approvals come for Delhi, I think we should see some time, in 12 to 15 months kind of a timeframe, which I think once we have clarity we\'ll give guidance.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>As you know, the initial build is done by the local partner. So, our main requirement of CapEx is the only technology, am I right, Anant, which will happen in the...</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="10" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>That\'s correct. Most of the money that would be used would be when the building is ready and when we put the &#x2013; ready to put the equipment.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>So, we are looking at nearly two years, two-and-a-half years from now when the finances are required in terms of technology at that point, for the Delhi project. For Kochi also we\'re the same way, the building is being done by the owner of the building. So, we are also looking at when the approvals will come and the building, once we get some clarity, we\'ll certainly inform.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Right. Thank you. And if I just squeeze one last question on Strand. It looks like last year <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:37:56) lot of profitability from the merger with Strand, because we had profit in our entity which now is monitory in Strand\'s equity. So, if you could just give us some clarity on when you expect the joint venture with Strand to breakeven on an EBITDA basis?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. As you know Strand is a different company, we\'re about 38% owner of Strand. We also have a private equity investor. For the whole idea, the Strand was the growth of the company in terms of revenue which is very important for us and we expect the combined revenue to grow significantly. We expect the combined revenue growth to be nearly like 35%, 40% this year. And also you might have read that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:38:46) acquisition which we\'ve announced, that also will add to our revenue.</p>\r\n          <p>So, the reason I cannot definitely tell you when the breakeven happen is because of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:38:57) acquisition. So, that has to be factoring in before I can have a definite guidance on when we\'ll breakeven. But as it is now, we are expecting that next FY 2020, Strand\'s to breakeven. But now with the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:39:12) acquisition, we will have to redo and see when it will happen, but we believe it\'s a good strategic acquisition, it gives us the pan-India presence and also there is enormous interest in our bioinformatics analytics happening. So we see all around very positive in terms of what is going to happen with Strands and the future growth of Strands.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>All right.

This new center at Rajkot, just wanted to confirm that it\'s a multispecialty hospital that you\'ve opened there?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah, at present it is a multispecialty hospital with the possibility of adding oncology there. We are going to be doing medical oncology as well as surgical oncology now, just like we did in Bhavnagar, we are looking at the future possibility of adding linear accelerator also. But oncology in terms &#x2013; as you know there are three branches, medical and surgical will be there as of now.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="11" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Okay, so far, most of our earlier centers have been in the oncology space, so are we open to looking at more multispecialty tertiary care hospitals going forward? Or is this like a one-off?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>It is really one-off; as you know, our &#x2013; when you look at our revenue model, nearly 80% or so is coming from oncology and as you know, the number of centers which are opening on oncology we see that has a growth in oncology, but Gujarat is the exception. Gujarat, where we have most of our multispecialty hospitals, including the first one which started there because of the fact that we couldn\'t convert that into oncology. With that experience, our Dr. Bharat Gadhavi heads the business head of that, started off with a center in Bhavnagar which was shut down and was acquired and doing well. And we have added oncology.</p>\r\n          <p>Similarly, with a group of doctors we are doing in Rajkot. So as you said, it is one-off, one of those centers coming up in Gujarat but as a platform, we certainly do not have plans to do multispecialty like we have done in oncology. So if you see, on a very selective basis, if it all.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="11" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>All right. And the finance cost for the quarter. What is the MTM loss on account of reinstatement of loans, included in that number of INR 24 crores?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>8.9%.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Crores.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="11" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>INR 8.9 crores?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>INR 8.9 crores.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="11" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Okay. Yeah and one last question is, I know you don\'t share the profitability at Milann level, but just wanted to check if the EBITDA margins that we are in a positive EBITDA margin territory at the subsidiary level, at Milann level?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>At present, definitely it is profitable level, it has always been at a profitable level, EBITDA margin, and we expect it to increase as we go forward.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="11" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Okay. That\'s all from my side.

Please go ahead.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the follow up. So the first is on Rajkot again. So could you just tell us what amount of CapEx you had to spend for Rajkot?</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>It\'s about INR 15 crores or so. INR 15 crores to INR 20 crores. But, mostly around INR 15 crores.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Right.

As you know, we have a 26% partner also, they would be sharing in this.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>All right. Makes sense. And second bit is, just CapEx going forward, so I think, you mentioned in the opening remarks that most of the CapEx for this year seems to be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:44:39) a little bit in the final quarter. Could you just give us some clarity on how you\'re looking at CapEx, maybe for FY 2020 and beyond, given that this is the Kochi and Delhi facility centers.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Pardon, can you repeat the question? Somehow I missed.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>Yeah. Just looking on clarity on what the quantum of CapEx outgo could be in FY 2020 and beyond, given that the Kochi and Delhi facilities are in those years.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="2" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>As I said, those are the only two and we are &#x2013; as you know, from Q1 to Q2, we had INR 40 crores.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="3" type="a">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>INR 41 crores in Q2 and we expected to be at the same level in the coming quarter or slightly tapering down in the coming quarters. That\'s the way if we see the trend, but as doctor mentioned, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:45:25) regarding Kochi and Gurgaon, it\'s as and when it happens we will come back to you with a specific number.</p>\r\n        </plist>\r\n      </speaker>\r\n      <speaker id="9" type="q">\r\n        <plist>\r\n          <p>All right.
